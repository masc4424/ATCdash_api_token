## About the Project
The project I have created is a responsive dashboard that aims to monitor various E-commerce segments. These segments include Payment and Registration, which are vital aspects of any E-commerce platform. By monitoring these segments, the dashboard can quickly identify any issues or glitches that might arise and ensure that customers can complete their transactions seamlessly.

In addition to Payment and Registration, the dashboard also monitors SMS-LMS Sync, which refers to the synchronization between the SMS (student management system) and LMS (learning management system). This synchronization is critical for E-commerce platforms that offer online courses or training programs. The dashboard ensures that the SMS and LMS working properly so that no mismatch happens which makes it easy for support team to access and complete their queries.

Lastly, the dashboard monitors the LMS, which helps support team to monitor whether the recordings are uploading correctly , Class completions & license occupancy, Teachers are uploading their notes correctly or not, and lastly the attandance.

In summary, the project I have created is a responsive dashboard that monitors various E-commerce segments, including Payment and Registration, SMS-LMS Sync, SMS to Ticketing system, Support System Monitoring, and LMS. It ensures that these segments are functioning correctly, thereby enhancing the overall Monitoring for the Support Team.
